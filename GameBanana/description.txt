<h1>Wonder Mods</h1>A collection of tools and mods by Wonder<br><br>and by collection I mean... its just streaks for now<br><br>

<h2>Streaks<br></h2><hr><b>Auto mode</b><br>A streak counter will start at 0 when a SpeedrunTool save state is made. When this save state is loaded, the counter will increase by 1 if the room timer is complete, or reset to 0 otherwise.<br><b><br>Manual mode</b><br>Streaks will still be counted, but only by hotkeys. They will not reset or increment automatically.<br><br><i>Streaks will be enabled in "auto" mode by default.&nbsp;</i><br><br>Your best streak will be saved along-side your current streak (see screenshot).
