When this save state is loaded, the counter will increase by 1 if the room timer is complete, or reset to 0 otherwise.<br><b><br>Manual mode</b><br>Streaks will still be counted, but only by hotkeys. They will not reset or increment automatically.<br><br><i>Streaks will be enabled in "auto" mode by default.&nbsp;</i><br><br>Your best streak will be saved along-side your current streak (see screenshot).<br><br><br><h2>Return to Map Split</h2>Optionally add a button below the Return to Map button that will unpause the game and split the Speedrun Tool room timer after 31 frames. This is useful for timing segments that end in a Return To Map such as cassette grabs and several all red berries segments.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WonderGinger/WonderMods/refs/tags/0.2.0-beta/GameBanana/return%20to%20map%20split.png">
